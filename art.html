                        Honestly, Rainbow Dash was never my favourite when I was growing up, I didn't <i>dislike</i> her, but she wasn't my fave. I found her arrogant and abraisive, but over the years she's grown on me, especially her design

                        I've always loved Twilight, she was everything I wanted to be when I was younger. Her anxieties always hit a little too close to home, although we deal with them in different ways. I wish she didn't become a princess so soon, and that when she <i>did</i> become a princess I wish her friends joined her. At the end of the series we can see the others have visibly aged, but she's only grown bigger, much like Celestia :(

                        My mom bought me the <a href="https://renegadegamestudios.com/my-little-pony-roleplaying-game-core-rulebook/">my little pony roleplaying game</a> (basically dnd but ponies) for my birthday! I havent gotten a chance to play it yet (mainly because I'm hesitant to dm a game myself) but this is a pony I designed for fun using the rules :) I tried to stay closer to the show's artstyle, but I think it would've been better if I drew it in my own style
